This is my basic not-finished calculator. I started it a long time ago, when I was learning basics of programming. 
Even though it is not finished, it has basic funcionalities that can show my way of thinking and it was enough for me back then, also the visual side of it is quite appealing, based it on the iphone one ofcourse.
